			            <div class="row articleSection pt-md-4">
				            Genome is the collection of all genes in the body. Human's body has about <b>25 000 genes</b>.
				            The main purpose of genes is to produce proteins. Genes can be divided into: 
				            <ul>
			            		<li><b>Coding Sequence - 3%</b>: these genes are responsible for creating proteins. There are very similar in the most of organisms. 
			            		For instance human and mouse Coding Sequence is the same in 99%;</li>
			            		<li><b>Regulation Sequence - 97%</b>: determine what, when and how many proteins should be created by Coding Sequence.</li>			            		
			            	</ul>
			            </div>
			            <div class="row articleSection pt-md-4 mt-3">				            
							<b>The emergence object</b> is an object which can be changed by environment. For instance water can have following forms:
							<ul>
			            		<li><b>Ice</b>: environment temperature below 0 Celsius degrees;</li>
			            		<li><b>Water</b>: environment temperature between 0 and 100 Celsius degrees;</li>
			            		<li><b>Steam</b>: environemtn temperature above 100 Celsius degrees.</li>
			            	</ul> 
				            Genome is also such emergence object. It means that <b>genome is changed by environment</b>.				              
				            In other words genome is not one constant piece of music. It's rather music instrument. Environment can play different pieces of music on it.

			            		<li>Transcription.</li>

							<b>Genetic Selection</b> is the best known type of selections discovered by Karol Darwin. 
							This selection is very long - takes hundreds or thousands of years. This selection can be summarized with following sentence: 
							<b>biology proposes but the environment decides</b>. In other words: <b>Genetic Selection is our instrument with 25 000 strings</b>.

			            <div class="row articleSection pt-md-4 mt-3">				            
							<b>Epigenetic Selection</b> is much faster then Genetic Selection. Here genome can be changed during one or two generations.
							Goal of this selection is to adjust to rapid changes of environment like drought or cooling. Example: one woman was born on Sicily.
							She was very close to mother. But she moved to Paris for studing in medical school. And new environment changed her. She wasn't so close with mother.
							She focused on medicine. She got married and had child. But after born of the child she changed again. She focused only on the baby.
							She dropped medicine. She started to be very close to her mother agein. As her husband said: she started to be completely different person.
							In other words: <b>Epigenetic Selection is change in our instrument with 25 000 strings.</b>

							<b>Transcription Factors</b> changes our genome in the fastests way. It determines what, when and how many proteins should be produced in our body.
							Steps:
							<ul>
			            		<li><b>Factor's Convertion</b>: physical factors (what we see, hear, feel etc.) are converted into chemical factors;</li>
			            		<li><b>Factor's Transportation</b>: chemical factors are transported to synapses in a brain;</li>
			            		<li><b>Create Transcription Factors</b>: synapses converts chemical factors into transcription factors;</li>
			            		<li><b>Create Proteins</b>: transcription factors go to cells nuclei and decide what, when and how many proteins should be produced.</li>
			            	</ul>  			            				            
			            </div>
			            In other words: <b>Transcription Factors are fingers which play melody on our instrument with 25 000 strings.</b>

			            <div class="row articleSection pt-md-4">
				           Happiness and pleasure are strictly connected with resources which are necessary to live. We need three types of resources:

			            		<li><b>Food</b>: the least available. We store the greatest amount of it. We are dead after 40 days of lack of food.</li>

			            <div class="row articleSection pt-md-4 mt-3">				            
							Happiness and pleasure are related to the availability of resources and their storage:
							<ul>
			            		<li><b>Happiness</b>: is connected with all resources: air, water and food. We feel it when we <b>compensate for the shortages</b>. 
			            		For instance we feel happiness when we are thirsty and we dring glass of water;</li>
			            		<li><b>Pleasure</b>: is connected only with one resource: food. We feel it when we eat more then we need just <b>to stock a food for the future</b>. 
			            		For instance we feel pleasure when we full after dinner but we eat additional dessert.</li>

			            <div class="row articleSection pt-md-4 mt-3">				            
							But about <b>50 000 years ago human discovered art</b>. From this moment happiness and pleasure are not only connected with biological resources.
							Happiness and pleasure became connected with such abstract things like beauty, order etc. We started not to owe survival to pleasure and happiness.
							We started to live to feel happiness and pleasure.
