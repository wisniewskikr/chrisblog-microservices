			            <div class="row articleSection pt-md-4">
				            <ol>
				            	<li><b>Don't criticize, condemn, or complain</b>: Human nature does not like to admit fault. When people are criticized or humiliated, 
				            	they rarely respond well and will often become defensive and resent their critic. To handle people well, we must never criticize, 
				            	condemn or complain because it will never result in the behavior we desire. Additional information:
				            	<ul>
				            		<li>The science discovered tha animal learns quicker and remember longer if they are rewarded, not punished;</li>
				            		<li>When we criticize someone then very often this person won't change. He/she will try to find explainetion for his/her behaviors.
				            		Example: prisoners almost never admit that it's their fault to be in a prison. Almost always guilty is somebody else but not them.</li>				            		
				            	</ul> 				            	
				            	</li>
				            	<li><b>Give honest and sincere appreciation</b>: Appreciation is one of the most powerful tools in the world. 
				            	People will rarely work at their maximum potential under criticism, but honest appreciation brings out their best. 
				            	Appreciation, though, is not simple flattery, it must be sincere, meaningful and with love. Additional information:
				            	<ul>
				            		<li>The sense of importance is very important for human. They like to be appreciated;</li>
				            		<li>Lack of appreciation is very common reason for breakdown of relationships;</li>
				            		<li>Emerson said: Any person who I meet is in some area better them me. That's how I see people.</li>
				            	</ul>
				            	</li>
				            	<li><b>Arouse in the other person an eager want</b>: To get what we want from another person, 
				            	we must forget our own perspective and begin to see things from the point of view of others. 
				            	When we can combine our desires with their wants, they become eager to work with us and we can mutually achieve our objectives.
				            	Additional information:
				            	<ul>
				            		<li>You have always ask yourself: <b>How to make that he/she wants to do it?</b> Example: One couple had trouble getting their boy to eat. 
				            		Finally they said that if he eats everything then he will be stronger then other boys. This was something what this boy wanted. 
				               		From this moment he always ate everything.
				            		</li>
				            	</ul>
				            	</li>

			            <div class="row articleSection pt-md-4">
				            <ol>
				            	<li><b>Become genuinely interested in other people</b>: "You can make more friends in two months by being interested in them, 
				            	than in two years by making them interested in you." The only way to make quality, 
				            	lasting friendships is to learn to be genuinely interested in them and their interests.</li>
				            	<li><b>Smile</b>: Happiness does not depend on outside circumstances, but rather on inward attitudes. 
				            	Smiles are free to give and have an amazing ability to make others feel wonderful. Smile in everything that you do.
				            	Additional information:
				            	<ul>
				            		<li>Nobody is so reach that can live without it; Nobody is so poor that can not afford for it;</li>
				            		<li>Actions are more important then words. And smile says: I like you. I'm happy that I see you. You makes me happy;</li>
				            		<li>What we are wearing on the face is more important than what we are wearing on the body;</li>
				            		<li>The science discovered that actions and feelings are connected. So when you are happy then you smile. 
				            		But it also works opposite: when you smile then you become happy;</li>
				            		<li>Lincoln said: People are as happy as they think that they are happy. It means that what you poses or what you do dosen't make you happy.
				            		Important is what do you think about it.</li>
				            	</ul>
				            	</li>
				            	<li><b>Remember that a person's name is, to that person, the sweetest and most important sound in any language</b>: 
				            	"The average person is more interested in their own name than in all the other names in the world put together." 
				            	People love their names so much that they will often donate large amounts of money just to have a building named after themselves. 
				            	We can make people feel extremely valued and important by remembering their name.
				            	Additional information:
				            	<ul>
				            		<li>Good manners consist of small sacrifices.</li>
				            	</ul>
				            	</li>
				            	<li><b>Be a good listener. Encourage others to talk about themselves</b>: The easiest way to become a good conversationalist is to become a good listener. 
				            	To be a good listener, we must actually care about what people have to say. Many times people don't want an entertaining conversation partner; 
				            	they just want someone who will listen to them.
				            	Additional information:
				            	<ul>
				            		<li>Give the other person your full attention;</li>
				            		<li>Ask questions which your interlocutor answers with pleasure;</li>
				            		<li>When somebody argues then let him to talk. And at the end thank you for conversation. 
				            		Assure that you have listened more eager then he has argued.</li>
				            	</ul>
				            	</li>
				            	<li><b>Talk in terms of the other person's interest</b>:  The royal road to a person's heart is to talk about the things he or she treasures most. 
				            	If we talk to people about what they are interested in, they will feel valued and value us in return.</li>
				            	<li><b>Make the other person feel important - and do it sincerely</b>: The golden rule is to treat other people how we would like to be treated. 
				            	We love to feel important and so does everyone else. People will talk to us for hours if we allow them to talk about themselves. 
				            	If we can make people feel important in a sincere and appreciative way, then we will win all the friends we could ever dream of.
				            	Use often following sentences:
				            	<ul>
				            		<li>Could you ...?</li>
				            		<li>I'm sorry to disturb you but ...?</li>
				            		<li>Can I ask ...?</li>
				            		<li>Do you have something against than ...?</li>
				            		<li>Thank you.</li>
				            	</ul>
				            	</li>
				            </ol>

			            <div class="row articleSection pt-md-4">
				            <ol>				            	
				            	<li><b>The only way to get the best of an argument is to avoid it</b>: Whenever we argue with someone, no matter if we win or lose the argument, 
				            	we still lose. The other person will either feel humiliated or strengthened and will only seek to bolster their own position. 
				            	We must try to avoid arguments whenever we can.
				            	Additional information:
				            	<ul>
				            		<li>Be glad when you hear different opinion. Maybe you can learn something;</li>
				            		<li>Don't react instinctively. A person's class can be recognized by what upsets him;</li>
				            		<li>Listen first. Then talk;</li>
				            		<li>Look for common points;</li>
				            		<li>Give time you and your opponent to thing about topic;</li>
				            		<li>Thank you for conversation.</li>
				            	</ul>
				            	</li>
				            	<li><b>Show respect for the other person's opinions. Never say "You're wrong."</b>:  We must never tell people flat out that they are wrong. 
				            	It will only serve to offend them and insult their pride. No one likes to be humiliated; we must not be so blunt.
				            	Additional information:
				            	<ul>
				            		<li>You should say: I think that you are wrong. But maybe I'm wrog. I'm wrong very often. Please correct my if I'm wrog;</li>
				            		<li>When you admire that you can be wrong than you don't lose anything. But you can win a lot.</li>
				            	</ul>
				            	</li>
				            	<li><b>If you're wrong, admit it quickly and emphatically</b>: Whenever we are wrong we should admit it immediately. When we fight we never get enough, 
				            	but by yielding we often get more than we expected. When we admit that we are wrong people trust us and begin to sympathize with our way of thinking.
				            	Additional information:
				            	<ul>
				            		<li>If we know that we did something wrong it's better to say it first. It's better to admit it openly.</li>
				            	</ul>
				            	</li>
				            	<li><b>Begin in a friendly way</b>: "A drop of honey can catch more flies than a gallon of gall." If we begin our interactions with others in a friendly way, 
				            	people will be more receptive. Even if we are greatly upset, we must be friendly to influence people to our way of thinking.
				            	Additional information:
				            	<ul>
				            		<li>Is somebody says "No" first time then his proud won't let him change the opinion. So we shouldn't let him say "No". 
				            		He should say "Yes" as many times as possible;</li>
				            		<li>Chinese saying: Who goes slowly, goes far.</li>
				            	</ul>
				            	</li>
				            	<li><b>Start with questions to which the other person will answer yes</b>: Do not begin by emphasizing the aspects in which we and the other person differ. 
				            	Begin by emphasizing and continue emphasizing the things on which we agree. People must be started in the affirmative direction and they will often follow 
				            	readily. Never tell someone they are wrong, but rather lead them where we would like them to go with questions that they will answer "yes" to.</li>
				            	<li><b>Let the other person do a great deal of the talking</b>: People do not like listening to us boast, they enjoy doing the talking themselves. 
				            	Let them rationalize and talk about the idea, because it will taste much sweeter to them in their own mouth.
				            	Additional information:
				            	<ul>
				            		<li>Traditional saying: If you want to have enemies then be better than your friends. If you wan to have friengs then let them be better than you.</li>
				            	</ul>
				            	</li>
				            	<li><b>Let the other person feel the idea is his or hers</b>: People inherently like ideas they come to on their own better than those that are handed to them 
				            	on a platter. Ideas can best be carried out by allowing others to think they arrived at it themselves.</li>
				            	<li><b>Try honestly to see things from the other person's point of view</b>: Other people may often be wrong, but we cannot condemn them. 
				            	We must seek to understand them. Success in dealing with people requires a sympathetic grasp of the other person's viewpoint.</li>
				            	<li><b>Be sympathetic with the other person's ideas and desires</b>: People are hungering for sympathy. They want us to recognize all that they desire and feel. 
				            	If we can sympathize with others, they will appreciate our side as well and will often come around to our way of thinking.
				            	Additional information:
				            	<ul>
				            		<li>Useful sentance: I don't blame you what you are feeling. If I were you I would feel the same.</li>
				            	</ul>
				            	</li>
				            	<li><b>Appeal to the nobler motives</b>: Everyone likes to be glorious in their own eyes. People believe that they do things for noble and morally upright 
				            	reasons. If we can appeal to others' noble motives we can successfully convince them to follow our ideas.
				            	Additional information:
				            	<ul>
				            		<li>In most cases even frauds will behave honestly if we let them know that we think about them as good and honest people.</li>
				            	</ul>
				            	</li>
				            	<li><b>Dramatize your ideas</b>: In this fast-paced world, simply stating a truth isn't enough. The truth must be made vivid, interesting, and dramatic. 
				            	Television has been doing it for years. Sometimes ideas are not enough and we must dramatize them.</li>
				            	<li><b>Throw down a challenge</b>: The thing that most motivates people is the game. Everyone desires to excel and prove their worth. 
				            	If we want someone to do something, we must give them a challenge and they will often rise to meet it.
				            	Additional information:
				            	<ul>
				            		<li>The best motivation is a desire to be better then others;</li>
				            		<li>Ancient saying: Everybody is afraid but courageous people don't think about fear. They move forward, sometimes for a death, but always for a victory.</li>
				            	</ul>
				            	</li>

				            <ol>				            	
				            	<li><b>Begin with praise and honest appreciation</b>: People will do things begrudgingly for criticism and an iron-fisted leader, 
				            	but they will work wonders when they are praised and appreciated.
				            	Additional information:
				            	<ul>
				            		<li>Start with appreciation and then show mistakes. It's like with a dentist: first anesthetized and then pain.</li>
				            	</ul>
				            	</li>
				            	<li><b>Call attention to people's mistakes indirectly</b>: No one likes to make mistakes, especially in front of others. 
				            	Scolding and blaming only serve to humiliate. If we subtly and indirectly show people mistakes, they will appreciate us and be more likely to improve.
				            	Additional information:
				            	<ul>
				            		<li>Replace "but" with "and";</li>
				            		<li> Example of bad sentence: We are proud of you but if you work on your math then you will be better;</li>

				            	</ul>
				            	</li>
				            	<li><b>Talk about your own mistakes before criticizing the other person</b>: When something goes wrong, taking responsibility can help win others to your side. 
				            	People do not like to shoulder all the blame and taking credit for mistakes helps to remove the sting from our critiques of others.
				            	Additional information:
				            	<ul>
				            		<li>People easier admit their mistakes if you first talk about your mistakes.</li>				            		
				            	</ul>				            	
				            	</li>
				            	<li><b>Ask questions instead of giving direct orders</b>: No one likes to take orders. If we offer suggestions, rather than orders, it will boost others' 
				            	confidence and allow them to learn quickly from their mistakes.
				            	Additional information:
				            	<ul>
				            		<li>Lack of orders enables to save face;</li>
				            		<li>Lack of orders gives feeling of a importance;</li>

				            	</li>
				            	<li><b>Let the other person save face</b>: Nothing diminishes the dignity of a man quite like an insult to his pride. If we don't condemn our employees 
				            	in front of others and allow them to save face, they will be motivated to do better in the future and confident that they can.

				            	</li>
				            	<li><b>Praise every improvement</b>: People love to receive praise and admiration. If we truly want someone to improve at something, 
				            	we must praise their every advance. "Abilities wither under criticism, they blossom under encouragement."

				            	</li>
				            	<li><b>Give the other person a fine reputation to live up to</b>: If we give people a great reputation to live up to, they will desire to embody the 
				            	characteristics with which we have described them. People will work with vigor and confidence if they believe they can be better.

				            		<li>If you want to change people behavior, act as if that they've already possessed the desired feature;</li>
				            		<li>Tell people that you have good opinion about them - they are reasonable, will listen to arguments and change their mind if necessary - 
				            		and they will do everything to behave in such way.</li>
				            	</ul>				            	
				            	</li>
				            	<li><b>Use encouragement. Make the fault seem easy to correct</b>: If a desired outcome seems like a momentous task, people will give up and lose heart. 
				            	But if a fault seems easy to correct, they will readily jump at the opportunity to improve. If we frame objectives as small and easy improvements, 
				            	we will see dramatic increases in desire and success in our employees.</li>
				            	<li><b>Make the other person happy about doing what you suggest</b>: People will most often respond well when they desire to do the behavior put forth. 
				            	If we want to influence people and become effective leaders, we must learn to frame our desires in terms of others' desires.
