			            	 According to this equation result for Question 1 from Quiz is: <b>5 = 1/2 * 10</b> and <b>5 > 4</b> so that's why answer is <b>Yes</b>.
			            	 And also according to this equation result for Question 2 from Quiz is: <b>5 = 1/2 * 10</b> and <b>5 < 6</b> so that's why answer is <b>No</b>.

			            	Human's mind biologically consists of <b>two systems:</b> System 1 and System 2. 
			            	<b>System 1</b> is very fast and not requires a lot of effort but does not care about a complexity of problem. 
			            	<b>System 2</b> is slower and requires our effort to use it but gets much deeper into a complexity of problem.
			            	We make decisions basic on these two systems but <b>if System 1 provides answer which looks right then we don't use System 2</b>.
			            	We just save an energy. This feature - <b>basing on System 1 without verification of System 2</b> - very often creates following problems:
			            	<ul>
				            	<li>Problems with estimation Odds of Gain;</li>
				            	<li>Problems with estimation Values of Gain.</li>				            	
				            </ul>

			            <div class="row articleSection pt-md-4">
			            	Problem with System 1 and Odds of Gain estimations is such that 
			            	<b>System 1 estimates something as more possible if it comes to our mind faster</b>. And it works in most of cases.
			            	But sometimes it's not true. Reasons why <b>sometimes it does not work</b>: 
			            	<ul>
				            	<li><b>Biological Building</b>: human's mind is built it such way that prefers some solutions over other.
				            	For example: which words are more in English language: starting with the letter "r" or with the letter "r" on third position?
				            	And because for human's mind is much more easier to find words starting with the letter "r" so we think that this is true.
				            	But it's not;</li>
				            	<li><b>Repeated Information</b>: human's mind is built it such way that if something is repeated then it comes to our minds faster.
				            	For example: have more people died from disasters or from asthma? Correct answer is asthma but because news are full of information
				            	about disasters then most of people choose this answer as more possible;</li>
				            	<li><b>Hidden Information</b>: some information are available but hidden in our minds. We need System 2 to get to them.
				            	For instance: what is the probable profession for a quiet, calm and reading man: farmer or librarian? Most of people choose librarian.
				           		Only the use of System 2 makes us realize that there are many more farmers in the world than librarians.</li>				            	
				            </ul>
			            </div>
			            <div class="row articleSection pt-md-4 mt-3">
			            	<b>Advice</b>: try to verify results from System 1 by System 2 as often as it's possible. <b>Faster answer does not mean more likely.</b>      
			            </div>

			            <div class="row articleSection pt-md-4">
			            	Problems with System 1 and Odds of Gain estimations: 
			            	<ul>
				            	<li><b>Comparison with Other Products</b>: human very often estimate value of one thing by comparison with other things.
				            	Example 1: You want to buy a radio. In a shop near your house it costs 200$. In a shop on the other side of city it costs 100$.
				            	Most of people would go to the other side of city to but this cheaper. 
				            	Example 2: You want to buy a car. In a shop near you house it costs 50 000$. In a shop on the other side of city it costs 49 900$.
				            	Most of people wouldn't go to the other side of city to buty this cheaper;</li>
				            	<li><b>Comparison in Time</b>: if thing was cheaper in the past then people don't want to pay more in the future.
				            	They don't look at objective value but at historical changes;</li>
				            	<li><b>Decrease Future Values</b>: for human mind differences in future are smaller then now.
				            	People are impatient and want gratification now. 
				            	Example 1: You can get 900$ or 1000$ now. All of people choose 1000$.
				            	Example 2: You can get 900$ now or 1000$ in the future. Most of the people would choose 900$ now.</li>
