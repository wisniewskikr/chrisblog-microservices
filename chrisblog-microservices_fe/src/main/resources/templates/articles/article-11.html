			            <div class="row articleSection pt-md-4">
				            There is following history of motivation:
				            <ul>
			            		<li><b>Motivation 1.0</b>: the oldest motivatin. Is based on our natural needs, on our drives for: food, shelter, sex etc;</li>
			            		<li><b>Motivation 2.0</b>: is based on Adam Smith theory of economy. A work is not a pleasure.
			            		People work because they expect some reward. If they don't work good then they are punished.
			            		In other words this is "carrot-stick method";</li>
			            		<li><b>Motivation 2.1</b>: updated Motivation 2.0. Maslov proved that humans are different from horses.
			            		They need something more then money. So rules here are not so strict: looser outfit, looser schedule etc;</li>
			            		<li><b>Motivation 3.0</b>: our inner motivation. To achive Motivation 3.0 you have to have appropriate environment. 
			            		This environment should consists of three elements:
			            			<ol>
			            				<li><b>Autonomy</b></li>
			            				<li><b>Mastery</b></li>
			            				<li><b>Goal</b></li>
			            			</ol>
			            		</li>
			            	</ul>
			            </div>

				            Seven disadvantages of Motivation 2.0 - "carrot-stick method":
				            <ol>
			            		<li><b>Can destroy inner motivation</b>: human have build-in inner motivation. This is how children discover world -
			            		they are curious of everything. But it's very easy to destroy this motivation by:</li>
			            		<ul>
			            			<li><b>Payment</b>: if we start to pay for something then we change fun in work;</li>
			            			<li><b>Conditional Rewards "if - then"</b>: human start to thing about a reward not about task. 
			            			It's maybe good for short-term but it's not good in long-term;</li>
			            		</ul>	
			            		<li><b>Can lower results</b>: if we start to pay for something then very often we get lower results then if wouldn't do it. 
			            		Example: children in kindergarten were divided into two groups. One group got a picture award. The second group does not. 
			            		Children without award <b>got better results and were more interested with task</b>;</li>
			            		<li><b>Can destroy creativity</b>: payment narrows the point of view which kills creativity. Man sees only one solution instead of many. 
			            		Example: participants of creativity experiment were divided into two groups. One group got a award if task was done fast. 
			            		Second group does not. <b>Creativity task was done much faster by participants without payment</b>;</li>
			            		<li><b>Can destroy good behavior</b>: if people start getting paid for some moral behavior then that behavior shifts from morality to work.
			            		Example: when blood donors began to be paid then their <b>number decreased</b>;</li>
			            		<li><b>Can encourage to cheating</b>: because payment shifts behavior from morality to work then it's 
			            		<b>easier to start cheating</b> to get expected result;</li>
			            		<li><b>Can be addictive</b>: the reward must be <b>bigger each time</b> to keep the motivation at the same level;</li>
			            		<li><b>Can promote short-sighted thinking</b>: because this motivation is focused on current results 
			            		then human start thinking only about <b>short-term results</b>. He does not consider long-term results.</li>				            		
			            	</ol>
			            </div>
			            
			            <h2 class="mb-3 mt-5 articleSectionTitle">Three elements of Motivation 3.0 - Autonomy</h2>				            
			            <div class="row articleSection pt-md-4">
				            <b>Autonomy</b> means that you have a goal and you approach it by whatever path you want. Autonomy is not the same as independence 
				            where you don't depend on anyone. Research shows that in the long run autonomic motivation is better than the stick and the carrot motivation.
				            People are more satisfied with their work.
				        </div>
				        <div class="row articleSection pt-md-4 mt-3">
			            	Four elements of autonomy:  
			            	<ol>
	            				<li><b>What you do</b>: you alone choose tasks to do;</li>
	            				<li><b>When you do:</b> you work when you want. Time-frames should be flexible. Important is result;</li>
	            				<li><b>How you do:</b> you choose your own tools;</li>
	            				<li><b>Who you do with:</b> you choose your partners to work.</li>
	            			</ol>     
			            </div> 
			            
			            <h2 class="mb-3 mt-5 articleSectionTitle">Three elements of Motivation 3.0 - Mastery</h2>
			            <div class="row articleSection pt-md-4">
				            <b>Flow</b> means that you you are fully engaged in your current activity. You are losing track of time. Nothing else matters at the moment.
				            Flow is short-term. There are two elements of flow:
				            <ol>
	            				<li><b>Task has to be adjusted</b>: it cannot be too easy or too difficult. If task is too easy then you start be bored. 
	            				If task is too difficult then you start be stressed;</li>
	            				<li><b>Task has to be fun</b>: the task must be a reward in itself. You do this task because it's fun.</li>	            				
	            			</ol> 
				        </div>				            
			            <div class="row articleSection pt-md-4 mt-3">
				            <b>Mastery</b> means that you want to be better in some activity. But it has to be yours own decision - not your boss or family.
				            Mastery is long-term. There are three elements of mastery:
				            <ol>
	            				<li><b>Mastery is way of thinking</b>: intelligence is flexible. It can be developed. 
	            				Proof: taxi drivers in London have very developed part of brain responsible for memory and orientation in the field
	            				because they have to remember thousands of streets;</li>
	            				<li><b>Mastery is a pain</b>: it's a pain, pain and sometimes flow. But it gives your life the sense;</li>
	            				<li><b>Mastery is a asymptote</b>: you can be very close but you will never fully achieve this goal.</li>		            				
	            			</ol> 
				        </div>	
				        
				        <h2 class="mb-3 mt-5 articleSectionTitle">Three elements of Motivation 3.0 - Goal</h2>
			            <div class="row articleSection pt-md-4">
				            <b>Goal</b> this is something what you want to achieve. Something so important for you that you are able to put an effort to achieve it.
				            Goal gives the life an energy of activation.
				        </div>
				        <div class="row articleSection pt-md-4 mt-3">
				            Goal shouldn't be just money. Money was a goal of Motivation 2.0. Motivation 3.0 does not ignore money but after some threshold 
				            they are not so important. It has to be something more. For instance charity work. Example: TOMS company has following strategy
				            that if you buy one pair of shoes then second pair goes to poor families.
